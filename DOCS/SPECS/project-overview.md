### **System Breakdown**

#### **1. Tenant Management (Multi-Tenant Infrastructure)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Each **Tenant** (your paying customers) has their own managed space within your SaaS.
  - Tenants can create **articles, content, and membership levels**.
  - Each Tenant has **Subscribers** (end-users who pay for access).

- **Implementation Approach:**
  - **Shared Database with Row-Level Security (RLS)** to ensure isolation.
  - Each Tenant gets a **Tenant ID**, ensuring their subscribers and content are segregated.
  - **Feature Flags** to control which features each Tenant has access to (free, pro, enterprise).

---

#### **2. Subscriber Management (Per-Tenant Subscribers)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Each Tenant has their own **Subscribers** (users who pay for content access).
  - Subscribers are registered to a Tenant, meaning their login and permissions are **unique to that Tenant**.
  - Payment is handled at the **Tenant level** (i.e., each Tenant collects payments independently via Stripe Connect).

- **Implementation Approach:**
  - **Database Design:**  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE subscribers (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
      email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
      subscription_status TEXT CHECK (subscription_status IN ('active', 'canceled', 'trial'))
    );
    ```
  - **Auth System:**  
    - Each Tenant has **isolated authentication** using Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth.
    - A subscriber logs into the **Tenant’s site**, not the main SaaS platform.
    - JWT Tokens verify membership level when accessing content.

---

#### **3. Content Management for Tenants (Articles & Membership Tiers)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Tenants create **articles, premium content, videos, and gated content**.
  - Each piece of content has an **access level** (free, premium, VIP, etc.).
  - Subscribers can view content based on their membership level.

- **Implementation Approach:**
  - **Database Structure for Content:**  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE articles (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
      title TEXT NOT NULL,
      content TEXT NOT NULL,
      access_level TEXT CHECK (access_level IN ('free', 'premium', 'vip'))
    );
    ```
  - **Feature Flag for Advanced Content Management:**  
    - Some tenants might get additional content types (videos, downloads, etc.).
    - Use a feature flag like `"enable_video_support": true` to toggle features per Tenant.

---

#### **4. Payment Processing (Stripe Connect per Tenant)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Each Tenant **creates their own pricing plans** (e.g., Monthly, Yearly, One-Time).
  - Payments are handled through **Stripe Connect**, so the Tenant gets paid directly.
  - Subscribers purchase **access to content via Stripe checkout**.

- **Implementation Approach:**
  - **Stripe Connect Integration:**
    - Tenants register their Stripe account via **Stripe Connect**.
    - Your platform handles **subscription payments, renewals, and access management**.
  - **Webhook System to Sync Payment Status:**
    ```javascript
    app.post('/webhooks/stripe', express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async (req, res) => {
      const event = req.body;
      switch (event.type) {
        case 'checkout.session.completed':
          await grantSubscriberAccess(event.data);
          break;
        case 'invoice.payment_failed':
          await revokeSubscriberAccess(event.data);
          break;
      }
      res.sendStatus(200);
    });
    ```

---

#### **5. Content Gating & API Integration (How Content is Protected)**
- **What it does:**  
  - Each static website (React, HTML, WordPress, etc.) loads an **embeddable JavaScript Widget**.
  - The widget communicates with your API to **verify user access**.
  - If the user is authorized, they see content. If not, they get a **paywall**.

- **Implementation Approach:**
  - **Frontend JavaScript Widget:**
    ```html
    <div id="content-gate" data-article-id="123">
      Loading content...
    </div>
    <script src="https://your-saas.com/embed.js"></script>
    ```
  - **JavaScript API Call to Check Access:**
    ```javascript
    async function checkAccess(articleId) {
      const token = localStorage.getItem("subscriber_token");
      const response = await fetch(`https://your-saas.com/api/access/${articleId}`, {
        headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}` }
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      if (!data.accessGranted) {
        document.getElementById("content-gate").innerHTML = "<p>You need a subscription to view this content.</p>";
      } else {
        document.getElementById("content-gate").innerHTML = data.articleContent;
      }
    }
    checkAccess(document.getElementById("content-gate").dataset.articleId);
    ```

---

#### **6. WordPress Plugin for Future Expansion**
- **What it does:**  
  - Later, you could create a **WordPress plugin** that:
    - Automatically **installs the JavaScript Widget**.
    - Syncs WordPress users with the **Subscriber system**.
    - Allows Tenants to **control access inside WordPress**.

- **Implementation Plan:**
  - Use **WordPress REST API** to sync users with your platform.
  - Auto-insert the widget inside **WordPress content pages**.
  - Handle **shortcodes like `[protect content="vip"]`**.

---

### **System Flow Example**
1. **Tenant Onboards** → Signs up, creates a Stripe account via Stripe Connect.
2. **Tenant Adds Content** → Uploads articles, sets access levels.
3. **Subscriber Registers** → Pays for a membership plan.
4. **User Accesses Content** → The embeddable widget checks their membership level and grants/restricts access.
5. **Payments & Renewals** → Stripe handles subscriptions, webhooks update the database.

---

### **How This Scales**
✅ **Supports multiple website types** (React, HTML, WordPress)  
✅ **Tenants have full control** over their own subscribers  
✅ **Stripe Connect ensures each Tenant gets paid directly**  
✅ **Feature Flags allow future expansion** (WordPress, Video Support, Custom Membership Rules)  
✅ **API-first approach makes it easy to extend**
