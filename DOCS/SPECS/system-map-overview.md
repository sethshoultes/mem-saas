**Detailed Integration Flow**

1. **User Management (Foundation)**
   - **Role**:  
     Acts as the central hub for user data, authentication, and authorization using Supabase Auth.  
   - **Integration**:  
     - Both the Multi-Tenant Platform and Administration System rely on this module.
     - Provides JWT tokens and role-based information to secure API calls across modules.

2. **Tenant Management (Multi-Tenant Infrastructure)**
   - **Role**:  
     Ensures data isolation and proper segmentation of users, memberships, and transactions per tenant.
   - **Integration**:  
     - Applies tenant IDs and Supabase RLS policies across all database queries.
     - Connects with User Management to enforce that users only access data for their tenant.

3. **Membership Management (Core Functionality)**
   - **Role**:  
     Enables tenants to create and manage membership levels and defines access rules for content.
   - **Integration**:  
     - Uses user and tenant information to map membership levels.
     - Communicates with Payment Integration to update membership statuses upon successful transactions.
     - Feeds access rules into the Content Gating module.

4. **Payment Integration (Financial Processing)**
   - **Role**:  
     Manages payment processing, subscriptions, and financial transactions using Stripe Connect.
   - **Integration**:  
     - Receives webhook events (e.g., successful payment, subscription updates) and updates Membership Management.
     - Provides transaction data and status updates to the Dashboard & Analytics for monitoring.
     - Enables manual intervention via the Administration System for refunds or adjustments.

5. **Content Gating (Access Control)**
   - **Role**:  
     Dynamically restricts or allows content based on user membership status.
   - **Integration**:  
     - Receives membership status and access rules from Membership Management.
     - Exposes API endpoints used by the Widget Integration for real-time content access validation.

6. **Widget Integration (Client-Side Implementation)**
   - **Role**:  
     An embeddable JavaScript widget placed on static HTML sites to enforce content gating.
   - **Integration**:  
     - Communicates with the API Gateway to check a user’s membership status.
     - Uses tokens from User Management and rules from Membership Management.
     - Provides real-time feedback to end users (e.g., “You need a premium membership to view this content”).

7. **Dashboard & Analytics (Monitoring)**
   - **Role**:  
     Provides an administrative interface and reporting dashboard for monitoring the entire system.
   - **Integration**:  
     - Aggregates data from User Management, Tenant Management, Membership Management, Payment Integration, and Content Gating.
     - Offers both high-level overviews and detailed reports to administrators.
     - Supports real-time data visualization using Supabase Realtime and other data pipelines.

**Summary of Interactions**

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  User Management ensures secure access across all modules with tenant isolation enforced by Tenant Management.

- **Core Business Logic:**  
  Membership Management serves as the heart of the platform, dictating user access to gated content while being updated by Payment Integration.

- **Real-Time Client Experience:**  
  The Widget Integration utilizes real-time API checks (backed by Content Gating and Membership Management) to determine content visibility on static HTML sites.

- **Administrative Oversight:**  
  The Dashboard & Analytics module aggregates data from every system (users, tenants, memberships, payments, content access) to provide comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities via the Administration System.
